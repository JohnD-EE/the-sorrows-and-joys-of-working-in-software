# Chapter 11: Beauty

## Intent:
As a conscientious Software Engineer, there is a constant desire to achieve excellence in the craft.  We strive to not only create functional code, but also to imbue it with beauty and elegance.  The goal is to create something so simple and refined that it transcends its utilitarian purpose and becomes a work of art that can touch the soul of the most cycnical of code reviewers, giving them a glimpse into the divine.  Well, perhaps that's taking the beauty analogy too far, but the code we produce is a reflection of our skill and mastery, and testament to the patient hard work and humble dedication we have invested in our craft.  True craftsmanship is taking pride in the detail of the work itself, regardless of whether your efforts are noticed.  When we achieve a certain level of mastery, our code becomes a source of pride and inspiration to ourselves and others, a symbol of the passion, pride and dedication we have for our work.

Here we reveal the joy of aspiring to a higher ideal in our craft, carefully producing a works of art as a master of our profession, and overcoming the ignorance of those who will try to tame our striving for beauty and instead would have us build architectural carbuncles to blight our digital landscape.

## Joys
This book, according to the title, is supposed to be about the sorrows and the joys of working in software.  Whether due to my own personal outlook, or the nature of working in software, the book is actually heavily weighted towards the sorrows.  The cynic is the wounded idealist, but here we can throw off some of the pessimistic shackles and indulge in the joyful, the beautiful, the inspirational, the divine side of building software.
