# Chapter 11: Beauty

## Intent
As a Software Engineer, there is a constant desire to achieve excellence in the craft. We strive to not only create functional code, but also to imbue it with beauty and elegance.  The goal is to create something so simple and refined that it transcends its utilitarian purpose and becomes a work of art that can touch the soul.  When we are successful, it is a thing of wonder, a glimpse into the divine.  Our code becomes a reflection of our skill and mastery, and testament to the hard work and dedication we have invested in our craft.  True craftsmanship is aspiring to create code that is a joy to behold.  It is about crafting something so simple and elegant that it touches the soul, and in doing so, exposes the surrounding ugliness for its shameful negligence.  When we achieve this level of mastery, our code becomes a source of pride and inspiration, a symbol of the passion and dedication we have for our craft.

Here we reveal the joy of aspiring to a higher ideal in our craft, carefully producing a works of art as a master of our profession, and overcoming the ignorance of those who will try to tame our striving for beauty.
