# Chapter 3: Meaning

## Intent:
We live in absurd times and our desire to make sense of it all and find meaning in our everyday experiences is a fundamental aspect of being human.  We want to understand our place in the world and find purpose and significance in our lives.  This search has been at the heart of many philosophical and spiritual traditions.  Some people find meaning through relationships, others through work or hobbies, and still others through religious or spiritual beliefs. Ultimately, the meaning we attribute to our lives is deeply personal and subjective.  We are chimps who learned to tell stories to give meaning to human existence.  Meaning is a blanket we weave for ourselves with the threads of our stories.

The intent of this chapter is to explore how our universal search for meaning relates to our work in Software Engineering during these absurd times of rapid technological and societal change.

## Meaninglessness
Many of us will struggle all of our lives with our search for ultimate meaning as we meander baffled and bewildered towards our graves.  Some will find solace in a belief system, devoting themselves to a pre-made meaning from religion, or perhaps latchning on to the latest theories of science.  Others may cling to a sense of enlightenment they've derived from a study of philosophy, or some kind of spiritual practice.  Personally, pondering ultimate meaning, why we are here, where we came from, where are we headed, what the heck does it all meany anyway, has consumed much of my cognitive and emotional energy.  The closest I've come to discovering what it's all about is inspired by the words of Kurt Vonnegut: "I tell you, we are here on Earth to fart around, and don't let anybody tell you different".  That's the key for me, to appreciate that the elusiveness of ultimate meaning is the very thing that makes life worth living.  If we were given a meaning, it would take away our freedom to live out our lives in the way of our choosing.  It would take away all self expression, all creativity, all aspiration.  It would be like your boss giving you a goal that you had no involvement in agreeing to.
