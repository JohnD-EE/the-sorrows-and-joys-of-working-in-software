# Chapter 3: Meaning

## Intent:
We live in absurd times and our desire to make sense of it all and find meaning in our everyday experiences is a fundamental aspect of being human.  We want to understand our place in the world and find purpose and significance in our lives.  This search has been at the heart of many philosophical and spiritual traditions.  Some people find meaning through relationships, others through work or hobbies, and still others through religious or spiritual beliefs. Ultimately, the meaning we attribute to our lives is deeply personal and subjective.  We are chimps who learned to tell stories to give meaning to human existence.  Meaning is a blanket we weave for ourselves with the threads of our stories.

The intent of this chapter is to explore how our universal search for meaning relates to our work in Software Engineering during these absurd times of rapid technological and societal change.

## Meaninglessness
Many of us will struggle all of our lives with our search for ultimate meaning as we meander baffled and bewildered towards our graves.  Some will find solace in a belief system, devoting themselves to a pre-made meaning from religion, or perhaps latchning on to the latest theories of science.  Others may cling to a sense of enlightenment they've derived from a study of philosophy, or some kind of spiritual practice.  Personally, pondering ultimate meaning, why we are here, where we came from, where are we headed, what the heck does it all meany anyway, has consumed much of my cognitive and emotional energy.  The closest I've come to discovering what it's all about is inspired by the words of Kurt Vonnegut: "I tell you, we are here on Earth to fart around, and don't let anybody tell you different".  That's the key for me, to appreciate that the elusiveness of ultimate meaning is the very thing that makes life worth living.  If we were given a meaning, it would take away our freedom to live out our lives in the way of our choosing.  It would take away all self expression, all creativity, all aspiration.  It would be like your boss giving you a goal that you had no involvement in agreeing to.  

I must confess that the idea that meaningless could be so liberating hasn't fully dawned on me until writing this book.

## Hope
Hope lies in first of all understanding that life isn't a battle between good and evil but it's the dance that happens between the two, the yin and the yang.  The beast is within but it is not to be defeated, it is to be understood, embraced, listened to, and danced with.

As I have been researching and writing about the beast within, synchronicity served me the perfect close of this chapter from the UK artist Ren whom I discovered courtessy of a YouTube recommendation for his latest release, 'Hi Ren'.  I don't think I have ever witnessed a piece of music, or work of art that left me as surprised and stunned by I was a couple of days ago, at the close of 2022, an 'Annus horribilis' for me personally, when I heard this song for the first time.  From the opening scene to the psychotic story that unfolded in different movements of classical guitar mixed with rap and strange vocals.  Each section shows a young man, battling with himself and his art, whilst learning to live with an autoimmune disease which inflicted crippling pain on a young man in the prime of his life.  This most authentically honest work of art ends with a spoken epilogue which wiseely portrays the inner battles between as a dynamic dance between angels and demons which makes us uniqwuely human:

"When I was seventeen years old, I shouted out into an empty room, into a blank canvas that I would defeat the forces of evil
And for the next ten years of my life I suffered the consequences
With autoimmunity illness and psychosis

As I got older, I realized there were no real winners and there were no real losers in psychological warfare
But there were victims and there were students
It wasnâ€™t David versus Goliath, it was a pendulum
Eternally swaying from the dark to the light
And the more intensely that the light shone, the darker the shadow it cast

It was never really a battle for me to win, it was an eternal dance
And like a dance, the more rigid I became, the harder it got
The more I cursed my clumsy footsteps, the more I struggled
So I got older
And I learned to relax, and I learned to soften, and that dance got easier

It is this eternal dance that separates human beings from angels, from demons, from gods
And I must not forget, we must not forget, that we are human beings"
