# Chapter 3: Meaning

## Intent:
We live in absurd times and our desire to make sense of it all and find meaning in our everyday experiences is a fundamental aspect of being human.  We want to understand our place in the world and find purpose and significance in our lives.  This search has been at the heart of many philosophical and spiritual traditions.  Some people find meaning through relationships, others through work or hobbies, and still others through religious or spiritual beliefs. Ultimately, the meaning we attribute to our lives is deeply personal and subjective.  We are chimps who learned to tell stories to give meaning to human existence.  Meaning is a blanket we weave for ourselves with the threads of our stories.

The intent of this chapter is to explore how our universal search for meaning relates to our work in Software Engineering during these absurd times of rapid technological and societal change.
