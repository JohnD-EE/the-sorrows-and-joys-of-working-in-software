# Chapter 12: Wisdom

## Intent:
We live in an era of exponentiating social problems and global predicaments tempered with the promise of exponentiating advancements in technology with which to solve them.  However, the rapid pace of technological change also presents new challenges and ethical dilemmas and the ability of societies and governments to adapt to and effectively utilise technology effectively is dubious, to say the least.  Our stone age emotions and mediaeval institutions leave us poorly equipped to deal with the 'Promethean Gap' as we are incapable of imagining the consequences of our creations.  Responsible and ethical use of technology is far from guaranteed, and conversations about the morality of what we do with our God-like capacity to build anything we conceive in the digital landscape has never been more existentially important.  Our technical prowess is creating an ever larger Promethean Gap way beyond our human capacity to deal with it, raising a slew of ethical questions and concerns.  Technology augments our brilliance, but can also exponentially amplify our collective ignorance.

Computer Science as a discipline does not provide a systematic education in general humanism, a philosophical study of ethics and language, human history, psychology and sociology.  A lack of curiosity in these subjects can lead to a narrow, technical perspective on the use of technology and its ethical implications.

This chapter, and ultimately the whole damn book, aims to encourage the development of human wisdom in order to intelligently consider the moral impact of our collective technological genius.

## Cyborg Anthropology
Cyborg anthropology is a domain of study which observes the intersection between technology and human society.  It is concerned with understanding how technology shapes and is shaped by human culture, and how this can be studied from an anthropological perspective as our lives become ever more entwined with technology.

Technology has become an integral part of human society and culture.  Cyborg anthropology is therefore interested in exploring the ways in which technology has fundamentally altered the human experience, and how it has transformed our understanding of what it means to be human.  Some key themes include the role of technology in shaping human identity, the ways in which technology has changed the way we interact with one another and with the world around us, and the ethical implications of our increasing reliance on technology.

As Cyborg Anthropologist, Amber Case, argues, we're already cyborgs.  She posits that technology has become so integrated into our lives that we are all becoming cyborgs, as our screens and devices are extensions of our bodies and brains.  Case compares these tools to the stone tools and bronze arrows of the past, which became extensions of our physical selves.  She also discusses the concept of mental tools, such as cave paintings, which allowed humans to store information outside of themselves. She suggests that our phones and other devices have become so personal that they are like mental exoskeletons, external parts of our brains.  We are not ourselves when we are unplugged and offline.

## Technocratic Totalitariansm
I thought it would ironic to ask the OpenAI GPT Chat system to 'Tell me about Technocratic Totalitarianism'

> Technocratic totalitarianism is a hypothetical political system in which technology is used to exercise complete control over society. In a technocratic totalitarian system, the state would use advanced technology to monitor and regulate every aspect of individuals' lives, from their personal behavior and beliefs to their economic and political activities.
>
> The idea of technocratic totalitarianism is based on the belief that technology can be used to achieve a highly efficient and orderly society, in which individuals are carefully monitored and controlled in order to maximize social and economic productivity. In this system, the state would have complete control over the use of technology, and would use it to track and monitor individuals' behavior and activities in order to maintain social order and control.
>
> Critics of technocratic totalitarianism argue that such a system would be highly oppressive and would violate individuals' basic rights and freedoms. They argue that the use of technology to exercise total control over society would result in a lack of personal autonomy and a loss of privacy, and would ultimately undermine the very foundations of democracy and liberty.
>
> Overall, technocratic totalitarianism is a hypothetical political system in which technology is used to exercise complete control over society. While some may see this as a means of achieving a highly efficient and orderly society, others believe that such a system would be highly oppressive and would violate individuals' basic rights and freedoms.

## Sphere of Influence
Sphere of influecne is a more socially acceptable way of talking about the idea of power, and the power we have to influence other people.  Our power is determined by many factors including our skills and abilities, our knowledge over the domain in question, our credibility, our social networks, and our overall standing in the dominance hierarchy society.  Unless you are Elon Musk reading these words, or similarly connected those pulling the stings of global influence, it is unlikely that you are able to make a significant impact on the moral and ethical concerns of the world.

In the many conversations I have with Software Engineers and others in the Software ecosystems it is easy to notice that people do generally care about the ethical consequences of their work.  Code can be weaponised against humanity, used to manipulate people's decisions and behaviours in ways that are unfavourable to their prosperity and the prosperity of the world at large.  Our beautifully crafted algorithm can have far greater influence over humanity that the most tyranical dictator.  Arguably, the Software industry wields more power over humanity than any other intustry as technology pervades ever further into our everyday lives.  While people think about ethical issues concerning the uses of the software systems and applications they build, they equally acknowledge that it is difficult for them to influence the intended uses in a moral direction.  We must often blinker ourselves to the ethical consequences of the uses and misuses of our software and focus instead on the areas within our control, function, beauty, and the relationships with our colleagues.

A sobering thought, however, is that 'no man is an island' from the perspective of our universal interbeing, and every act, no matter how small, can be the tiny pebble thrown into the ocean of humanity which initiates a ripple effect that reverbersates through all of time and space.  Every choice we make in our day-to-day lives has an ethical aspect.  We can always choose the to do the right thing, no matter how subtle, which can nudge the world in a better direction.

## Head, Heart and Guts
This book has deliberately ventured outside of conservative thinking to explore different perspectives on Software Engineering.  One of the key ideas has been that conventional the conventional views on the competencies of a Software Engineer: problem solving; coding language proficiency; knowledge of data structures and algorithms; system design; testing and debugging; managing deployment pipelines; can be augmented and complimented by a more nuanced understanding of the human being from an existential perspective, the qualia of a Software Engineer.

The head, heart, and gut are often referred to as the three brains because they each have a unique role in influencing our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.

The head, or the cerebral cortex, is the largest and most complex of the three brains.  It is responsible for higher cognitive functions such as thinking, reasoning, and decision-making. The cerebral cortex contains approximately 100 billion neurons, or nerve cells, which communicate with each other through a network of pathways called synapses.

The heart, or the emotional brain, is responsible for our emotions and feelings.  It is located in the limbic system, which is a region of the brain that is involved in emotional processing and memory.  The heart has its own network of neurons and communicates with the cerebral cortex through the hypothalamus, a region of the brain that helps regulate the body's functions.

The gut, or the enteric nervous system, is located in the digestive system and is responsible for controlling digestion and other digestive functions.  The gut has its own network of neurons and can communicate with the other two brains through the vagus nerve, which runs from the brainstem to the digestive system.

Lately, there has been much more attention on the non-human bacteria, known as the microbiome, are found in both the gut and the brain, and they can influence our thinking and behaviour.  The microbiome is a diverse community of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microorganisms that live in and on our bodies.  The microbiome plays a role in a variety of processes in the body, including digestion, immune function, and brain function.  Some research suggests that the microbiome may influence behaviour and cognition by releasing substances that affect the brain and nervous system.

Doing the right thing requires guts, raw courage, fortitude.  You can be the hero of your own journey, not necesarily through grand acts of defiance risking all for your principles, but through small everyday acts of courage, whether it is setting sensible boundaries with others, challenging a colleague's solution design, or politely dissagreeing with a 'superior' in the organisational hierarchy.  This requires honesty, vulnerability, and a willingness to take a risk, but it also requires care and empathy for the person being challenged.  We all have different tolerance levels to social risk, simply saying "No", or "I don't know" can feel as threatening as the possibility of being physically attacked.  Standing up for what is right becomes easier with practice.  Bravery is an internal experience, it often goes unnoticed to external observers, but your internal acts of courage build up over time and become resources for doing more of the right thing in your Software Engineering journey.
