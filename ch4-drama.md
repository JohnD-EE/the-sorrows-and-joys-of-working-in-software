# Chapter 4: Drama

## Intent:
Software Engineering is not usually a solo pursuit.  We collaborate with others.  But 'hell is other people' as Sartre said and we have to navigate all the messiness of interpersonal relationships which can be far more complex and unpredictable than the most complicated of coding problems.  Motives are difficult to decipher and complex dramas can emerge from the games we play in our social lives.  We are social animals who need other people around us to give our lives significance, but paradoxically those people can become the primary source of our annoyances and frustrations.  Software Engineers sometimes feel awkward around other people and take refuge in their reliable inputs and outputs of their work, but we compromise our progress if if we bury our heads in the sand to the social side of life.

This chapter seeks to investigate the many dramas of life in Software Engineering, in an attempt to unravel the confusing behaviors of our colleagues and simplify the nuances of human interactions.
