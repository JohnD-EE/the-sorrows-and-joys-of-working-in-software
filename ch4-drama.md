# Chapter 4: Drama

## Intent:
Software Engineering is not usually a solo pursuit.  We collaborate with others.  But 'hell is other people' as Sartre said and we have to navigate all the messiness of interpersonal relationships which can be far more complex and unpredictable than the most complicated of coding problems.  Motives are difficult to decipher and complex dramas can emerge from the games we play in our social lives.  We are social animals who need other people around us to give our lives significance, but paradoxically those people can become the primary source of our annoyances and frustrations.  As soon as we are with other people we become acutely aware of where we are in the pecking order and become submissive or dominant according to our position.  Software Engineers sometimes feel awkward around other people and take refuge in their reliable inputs and outputs of their work, but we compromise our progress if if we bury our heads in the sand to the social side of life.

This chapter seeks to investigate the many dramas of life in Software Engineering, in an attempt to unravel the confusing behaviours of our colleagues and simplify the nuances of human interactions.

## A Multiplayer Game

## Sonder
Sonder was coined by John Koenig, auththo fo The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrowso to describe the realisation that each passerby has a life as complex and unique as one's own. This concept of the inner lives of others is often described as the "feeling of not being alone" or the recognition of the interconnectedness of humanity.

> n. the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own—populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness—an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you’ll never know existed, in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk.

We develop what psychologists call a 'theory of mind', which is the way we come up with theories about other people's states of mind, what they're thinking, from our observations of their behaviour.
