# Chapter 1: Beasts

## Intent:
Putting the possibility of alien insemination of the human race or any other creationist ideas to one side for a moment, the ancestry of a Software Engineer can be traced back to back through all the variety of evolutionary stages to the first microbial emergences upon the earth. Crouched over our keyboard enjoying a flow of synaptic joy at having optimised a complex algorithmic equation we forget the beastly vestiges of the past that haunt every decision we make, every action, every reaction, every over-reaction.  Despite our modern lifestyles and technological advancements, our primal instincts are the source of all our sorrows and joys.

The aim of this chapter is to explore the beast that lurks within, and how we navigate the vicissitudes of our hidden emotional life whilst maintaining the controlled superficial poise of a rational professional person working in Software.

## Computers don't have Eyebrows

## Embodied
As physical beings, humans are influenced by their bodies and their environment.  Our senses, movements, and physical sensations all play a role in shaping our thoughts, feelings, and behaviours.

## Survival
At a basic level, humans have a primal instinct for survival.  This includes the desire to find food, shelter, and safety, as well as the ability to protect ourselves and our social groups from harm.

## Fight, Flight, Freeze
If we were unable to sense and respond to danger in our ancestral environment, we'd not last long enough to find a mate, procreate, and raise offspring to serve nature's purpose of propegating our genenetics.  Nature bestowed upon us the instinctual 'fight or flight' response to confront or run from danger.  Triggered by a chain of firing synapses within our nervous system, a tiny region of our primitive brain, the hypothalamus, orchestrates the sudden release of stress hormones adrenaline, cortisol and noradrenaline which prepare the body for action.

We may also experience a 'freeze' response, where we become paralysed with fear or indecision.

Context is always relevent.  Our response to threats of danger will vary greatly depending on where we are, who we're with, the time of day, our state of mind, and many other factors.  A rollercoaster ride might be a thrill for many but terrifying for others.  Finding our way when lost in the woods might be a fun challenge with a group of friends, but a different story if we're alone, and it's dark.  For some, the social risk of asking a stranger out to lunch would be to much to bear, best to dine alone.

## Facing the Beast
To confront and overcome the beast within, it is necessary to face our primal instincts and understand their influence on our thoughts, actions, and behaviours.  This may involve acknowledging and accepting our emotions and desires, as well as learning how to regulate and manage them in a healthy way.

## Riding the Beast
Rather than trying to suppress or ignore our primal instincts, it is often more effective to learn how to "ride" them out.  This involves finding ways to channel our instincts and desires in constructive and healthy ways, such as through physical exercise, creative expression, or other activities that allow us to connect with our primal selves in a positive way.

## Integrating the Beast
In order to fully integrate the beast within, it is necessary to learn how to balance our primal instincts with our rational selves.  This may involve finding ways to express our desires and emotions in a healthy and appropriate way, and learning how to manage our reactions and behaviours in a way that is aligned with our values and goals.  The lion lies down with the lamb amd we can be at peace with the beast within.

## Ten Bulls
The Ten Bulls is a parable from the Zen Buddhist tradition that describes the journey of enlightenment.  It serves as a metaphor for the process of integrating the beast within and finding balance and harmony between our primal and rational selves.

## Human
We are human, all too human, as Nietszche reminds us.  As humans, we are more than just rational beings. We have emotions, desires, and personalities that shape our thoughts, actions, and behaviours.  By acknowledging and accepting our primal selves, we can learn to live in harmony with our rational selves and find balance and fulfillment in our lives.

## Irrationality
Our primal instincts and emotions can often lead us to behave in irrational or unpredictable ways.  By learning to manage and regulate our emotions, we can make more rational and logical decisions and avoid acting on impulse.

## Complicated
Human behaviour may seem complicated and difficult to understand.  It is influenced by a wide range of factors, including our experiences, environment, genetics, and personal history.

## Complex
Human behaviour may seem complicated, but actually it is complex.  Human behaviour is complex and multifaceted.  It is influenced by a wide range of factors, including our emotions, desires, and beliefs, as well as our social and cultural context.

## Acceptance
To fully integrate the beast within, it is important to learn to accept and acknowledge all aspects of ourselves, including the brutality of our primal instincts and messy emotions.  This may involve learning to be more self-aware and self-accepting, and practicing mindfulness and self-reflection in order to better understand and manage our thoughts, feelings, and behaviours.

## Mutability
Human behaviour is not fixed or unchanging.  We have the ability to adapt, change, and grow over time.  By learning to be more self-aware and self-reflective, we can better understand and manage our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and make conscious choices about the direction of our lives.  "Yes,there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run, there's still time to change the road you're on." - Led Zepelin, Stairway to Heaven.

## State Management
To effectively navigate the vicissitudes of our hidden emotional lives, it is important to learn how to manage our emotional states.  This may involve developing coping skills and strategies for regulating our emotions, such as mindfulness, self-reflection, and relaxation techniques.  We can also take control of our physical bodies, the food we eat and our daily exercise levels.  Motivation to work, to code, to learn, depends on our bodies to generate sufficient energy to do so.  Squander our physical, emotional and spiritual health and sooner or later we lose the energy to do the things we want to do.  

## Ephemerality
Human emotions and states of mind are often temporary and fleeting.  By learning to let go of negative emotions and embrace positive ones, we can better navigate the ups and downs of life.

## Decoupling
To effectively manage our emotional states, it is important to learn how to "decouple" or detach our thoughts and emotions from external events and circumstances. This involves developing a sense of inner resilience and the ability to regulate our emotions and behaviors in a healthy way.  

## Repression
Repression is the act of suppressing or denying thoughts or feelings that may be uncomfortable or unpleasant.  While it may be tempting to repress certain aspects of ourselves, it is important to learn how to acknowledge and accept all aspects of ourselves in order to fully integrate the beast within.

## Shadows
The unconscious or suppressed aspects of ourselves that we may be unaware of or unwilling to acknowledge.  By bringing these shadows into the light of consciousness, we can better understand and integrate them into our lives.

## Comfort
Our modern lives are comfortable, perhaps too comfortable.

## Growth

## Prudence

## Pride

## Error Logs

## Moths to the Flame
The phrase "moths to the flame" refers to the idea that we are drawn to things that may be harmful or destructive to us.  By learning to manage our primal instincts and desires, we can avoid being "moths to the flame" and make healthier, more informed choices.

## The Inner Game of Coding
You can only learn code by doing code, but doing code will take you into treacherous uncharted waters where you'll encounter mythical monsters of the deep that will swallow you whole, and it's inside the belly of the beast that you'll discover what you're made of, what will break you and what will make you, whether you can rescue yourself or whether you can follow the breadcrumbs of countless Software Engineers who have fallen this way before and surmount the unsurmountable.

Of course the sea monsters aren't real and you are only sailing unchartered waters of your mind when you are inevitably stretched beyond your previous limits.  Solving problems with code is hard.  You'll tie yourself in knots, you'll find yourself awash with self-doubt, shamed by comparing yourself to your idea of rockstar programmers, and stranded upon the sorrowful shores of inadequacy as you fight to overcome your limitations when wrestling with complicated code.

Coding is an inner game, and the beast within will reveal itself and make your life a misery.  The outer game is our commits to the codebase, our interractions with colleagues, our contribution in meetings.  The inner game is what's going inside our minds and bodies.  A large proportion of Tennis is an inner game, as is golf or snooker.  The Inner Game of Tennis was the first of the 'Inner Game' genres written by Timothy Gallwey that explores the psychological aspects of tennis and how they affect performance during a game.  According to Gallwey, the 'inner game' relates to the mental struggles and distractions that players face during a match, which can inhibit their ability to play their best.

The books discuss the role of the 'Self 1' and the 'Self 2' in the inner game.  Self 1 represents the ego, the part of the mind that is constantly evaluating and criticising our performance.  Self 2 is the inner wisdom and calm that allows us to perform at our best.  The goal of the inner game is to quieten Self 1 and allow Self 2 to take control, so the player trust their natural abilities and instincts.

Self 1 is the part of the mind that is responsible for conscious thoughts, judgements, and decision-making.  It is the part of the mind that is constantly analysing and trying to control the situation.  However, in the inner game, when Self 1 is too dominant it can be a hindrance to performance by getting in the way of the natural flow of the game, generating a stream of negative self-talk if we allow it.  We will tense up and make mistakes.  Self 2, on the other hand, is the unconscious, intuitive part of the mind that is responsible for physical movements and behaviours.  It is the part of the mind that is able to perform naturally, in flow, and without overthinking.  Self 2 is the part of our mind we need to learn to develop and trust in order to perform at our besr.

Quietening Self 1 requires us not to judge our actions as right or wrong, and to view outcomes neutrally as just data points.  You hit the ball into the net, it's just data.  You introduce a bug into production code, it's just data - train yourself to deal with the facts of the situation as a neutral observer, without applying judgement.  Letting go of self-judgment requires us to focus on the process rather than the outcome.  Continually reminding themselves to let go of self-judgement can help a player, or a Software Engineer, to stay relaxed and to avoid getting too caught up in the pressure of performing well.  The idea that we should trust the unconscious could be refuted by arguing that coding is primarily a conscious thinking game, however, coding itself is a cognitive activity, and much of what we do is from unconscious habit, or unconscious 'knowing'.  That feeling when we are in a state of flow and everything clicks effortlessley.  Much of what we do is pattern recognition, this is an unconscious activity based on our years of knowledge and  experience, trusting your unconscious is trusting your ability to do good pattern recognition to make better sense of the cognitive challenges you face.

Act the part - Embrace challenges - 

Just as in the inner game of tennis or golf, the key to success in the inner game of coding is to recognize and overcome these mental and emotional obstacles.  It's not about the external challenges you face, but rather how you approach and respond to them internally.  

Following Gallwey's examples in his books, here are some reflections on how to play the inner game of coding?

* The inner game of coding is played at the Razor's Edge, the edge of consciousness, or the point at which we are most aware of ourselves and the world around us.
* Be mindful that you are playing an inner game, the outcome of which is the outer game of creating a Pull Request.
* Find a path to a state of grace, of relaxed conentration, when you are coding.
* Realise that your opponent is not the person standing the other side of the net, it is you.
* The primary aim of the inner game when coding, or thinking, is to overcome self-interference and your self-imposed limitations.
* The inner game of coding is one that is played against your own habitual ways of getting in your own way.
* Our unforced errors are due to our haste, anxiety, lack of practice, lack of energy, or not setting boundaries within our environment.
* Outer game rewards of approval, recognition and success are not as important as the inner game rewards gained from personal and subjective experience.
* Outer games are usually finite games, there's a winner and an ending to the game.  Inner games are infinite, the aim is simply to keep playing.
* Coding solutions to challenging problems should feel like play.  We play games for fun, for love.  If it doesn't feel like play, you may be wise to change the game, or change the venue in which you are playing the game.
* If you can remove your internal obstacles to performance, yourself or with the help of a coach, you will fire up your natural ability to learn and perform.
* Inner peace is the key to outer success.

I can relate personally to the thinking from the inner game, not only in the various sports I've tried over the years, but also in learning and performing with musical instruments.  I play the guitar, an instrument that is very unforgiving of 'mistakes', especially when played through a 100 Watt amplifier.  A guitar string can be plucked in so many different ways, each creating a different shape to the sound.  Likewise, a note can be 'bent' up to resonate at different tone, it can be wobbled to cause vibrato, with slide, legato or even muted.  A guitar player is actively listening to the notes played in a constant feedback loop so that more or less pressure can be applied along with other modifications to reach the intended sound.  In effect, every note is a 'mistake' as the play wrestles the steel and nickel wound strings to resonate 'correctly' aginst the wood of the fretboard.  It can be easy to imagine yourself sounding like Jimi Hendrix playing along to a jam track in your own bedroom, but when you are performing to an audience of real people, you will notice your Self 1 taking over, aware and attentive to every unintend note, so much more noticable to the player than the crowd of people enjoying the music.

## Will

## Will to Power
The 'will to power' is the desire to exert control and influence over one's environment and circumstances.  While it is important to have a sense of agency and control in our lives, it is also important to be mindful of not letting the will to power become destructive or unhealthy.  It is important to strike a balance between assertiveness and respect for the needs and boundaries of others.
