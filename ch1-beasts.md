# Chapter 1: Beasts

## Intent:
Putting the possibility of alien insemination of the human race or any other creationist ideas to one side for a moment, the ancestry of a Software Engineer can be traced back to back through all the variety of evolutionary stages to the first microbial emergences upon the earth. Crouched over our keyboard enjoying a flow of synaptic joy at having optimised a complex algorithmic equation we forget the beastly vestiges of the past that haunt every decision we make, every action, every reaction, every over-reaction.  Despite our modern lifestyles and technological advancements, our primal instincts are the source of all our sorrows and joys.

The aim of this chapter is to explore the beast that lurks within, and how we navigate the vicissitudes of our hidden emotional life whilst maintaining the controlled superficial poise of a rational professional person working in Software.

## Computers don't have Eyebrows

## Embodied
As physical beings, humans are influenced by their bodies and their environment.  Our senses, movements, and physical sensations all play a role in shaping our thoughts, feelings, and behaviours.

## Survival
At a basic level, humans have a primal instinct for survival.  This includes the desire to find food, shelter, and safety, as well as the ability to protect ourselves and our social groups from harm.

## Fight, Flight, Freeze
If we were unable to sense and respond to danger in our ancestral environment, we'd not last long enough to find a mate, procreate, and raise offspring to serve nature's purpose of propegating our genenetics.  Nature bestowed upon us the instinctual 'fight or flight' response to confront or run from danger.  Triggered by a chain of firing synapses within our nervous system, a tiny region of our primitive brain, the hypothalamus, orchestrates the sudden release of stress hormones adrenaline, cortisol and noradrenaline which prepare the body for action.

We may also experience a 'freeze' response, where we become paralysed with fear or indecision.

## Facing the Beast
To confront and overcome the beast within, it is necessary to face our primal instincts and understand their influence on our thoughts, actions, and behaviours.  This may involve acknowledging and accepting our emotions and desires, as well as learning how to regulate and manage them in a healthy way.

## Riding the Beast
Rather than trying to suppress or ignore our primal instincts, it is often more effective to learn how to "ride" them out.  This involves finding ways to channel our instincts and desires in constructive and healthy ways, such as through physical exercise, creative expression, or other activities that allow us to connect with our primal selves in a positive way.

## Integrating the Beast
In order to fully integrate the beast within, it is necessary to learn how to balance our primal instincts with our rational selves.  This may involve finding ways to express our desires and emotions in a healthy and appropriate way, and learning how to manage our reactions and behaviours in a way that is aligned with our values and goals.  The lion lies down with the lamb amd we can be at peace with the beast within.

## Ten Bulls
The Ten Bulls is a parable from the Zen Buddhist tradition that describes the journey of enlightenment.  It serves as a metaphor for the process of integrating the beast within and finding balance and harmony between our primal and rational selves.

## Human
We are human, all too human, as Nietszche reminds us.  As humans, we are more than just rational beings. We have emotions, desires, and personalities that shape our thoughts, actions, and behaviours.  By acknowledging and accepting our primal selves, we can learn to live in harmony with our rational selves and find balance and fulfillment in our lives.

## Irrationality
Our primal instincts and emotions can often lead us to behave in irrational or unpredictable ways.  By learning to manage and regulate our emotions, we can make more rational and logical decisions and avoid acting on impulse.

## Complicated
Human behaviour may seem complicated and difficult to understand.  It is influenced by a wide range of factors, including our experiences, environment, genetics, and personal history.

## Complex
Human behaviour may seem complicated, but actually it is complex.  Human behaviour is complex and multifaceted.  It is influenced by a wide range of factors, including our emotions, desires, and beliefs, as well as our social and cultural context.

## Acceptance
To fully integrate the beast within, it is important to learn to accept and acknowledge all aspects of ourselves, including the brutality of our primal instincts and messy emotions.  This may involve learning to be more self-aware and self-accepting, and practicing mindfulness and self-reflection in order to better understand and manage our thoughts, feelings, and behaviours.

## Mutability
Human behaviour is not fixed or unchanging.  We have the ability to adapt, change, and grow over time.  By learning to be more self-aware and self-reflective, we can better understand and manage our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and make conscious choices about the direction of our lives.  "Yes,there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run, there's still time to change the road you're on." - Led Zepelin, Stairway to Heaven.

## State Management
To effectively navigate the vicissitudes of our hidden emotional lives, it is important to learn how to manage our emotional states.  This may involve developing coping skills and strategies for regulating our emotions, such as mindfulness, self-reflection, and relaxation techniques.  We can also take control of our physical bodies, the food we eat and our daily exercise levels.  Motivation to work, to code, to learn, depends on our bodies to generate sufficient energy to do so.  Squander our physical, emotional and spiritual health and sooner or later we lose the energy to do the things we want to do.  

## Ephemerality
Human emotions and states of mind are often temporary and fleeting.  By learning to let go of negative emotions and embrace positive ones, we can better navigate the ups and downs of life.

## Decoupling
To effectively manage our emotional states, it is important to learn how to "decouple" or detach our thoughts and emotions from external events and circumstances. This involves developing a sense of inner resilience and the ability to regulate our emotions and behaviors in a healthy way.  

## Repression
Repression is the act of suppressing or denying thoughts or feelings that may be uncomfortable or unpleasant.  While it may be tempting to repress certain aspects of ourselves, it is important to learn how to acknowledge and accept all aspects of ourselves in order to fully integrate the beast within.

## Shadows
The unconscious or suppressed aspects of ourselves that we may be unaware of or unwilling to acknowledge.  By bringing these shadows into the light of consciousness, we can better understand and integrate them into our lives.

## Comfort
Our modern lives are comfortable, perhaps too comfortable.

## Growth

## Prudence

## Pride

## Error Logs

## Moths to the Flame
The phrase "moths to the flame" refers to the idea that we are drawn to things that may be harmful or destructive to us.  By learning to manage our primal instincts and desires, we can avoid being "moths to the flame" and make healthier, more informed choices.

## Will

## Will to Power
The 'will to power' is the desire to exert control and influence over one's environment and circumstances.  While it is important to have a sense of agency and control in our lives, it is also important to be mindful of not letting the will to power become destructive or unhealthy.  It is important to strike a balance between assertiveness and respect for the needs and boundaries of others.
