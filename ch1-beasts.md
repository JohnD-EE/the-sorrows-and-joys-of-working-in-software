# Chapter 1: Beasts

## Intent:
Putting the possibility of alien insemination of the human race or any other creationist ideas to one side for a moment, the ancestry of a Software Engineer can be traced back to back through all the variety of evolutionary stages to the first microbial emergences upon the earth. Crouched over our keyboard enjoying a flow of synaptic joy at having optimised a complex algorithmic equation we forget the beastly vestiges of the past that haunt every decision we make, every action, every reaction, every over-reaction.  Despite our modern lifestyles and technological advancements, our primal instincts are the source of all our sorrows and joys.

The intent of this chapter is to explore the beast that lurks within, and how we navigate the vicissitudes of our hidden emotional life whilst maintaining the controlled superficial poise of a rational professional person working in Software.
