# Chapter 5: Tribes

## Intent:
The study of Sociology is arguably as relevant to Software Engineering as Computer Science.  Whether we are a small band of hunter-gatherers coordinating the capture of our next meal accross the lush Paleolithic grasslands of the Sahara, or a team of Engineers collaborating to build, test and deploy a new feature, we will naturally form groups to work towards a shared goal.  A sense of identy will emerge from within our small groups as we develop our own subcultures, our own in-jokes, styles, languages and preferences.  We may begin to find ourselves conforming to the expectations of others in our group, seeking status and good standing within the group, and may develop a shared dislike for other groups, feeling the need to protect and defend the values of our own group against the crazy batshit ways of the others.  The tribes we belong to, our teams, friendship circles, political allies, companies, favourite sports teams, music fan clubs, countries, religious allegiences, all become intertwined with our own ego, an inseperable part of us.

This chapter looks at how our tribal tendancies affect our thoughts, feelings and behaviours, with the aim of helping us to collaborate more wisely in groups of fellow humans.

## Tribes of Engineers
Tribalsim in Software Engineering

Tribalism is a form of behaviour that is characterised by the strong identification of individuals with their social group, and their intense loyalty to their group.  In the context of software engineering, tribalism can manifest itself in various ways.  For example, some software engineers may identify strongly with a particular programming language, framework, or methodology, and may show a strong preference for using these tools and approaches even when they may not be the best choice for a given project.  This can lead to conflicts and divisions within a team, as members who identify with different tribes may have difficulty working together and may be less willing to consider alternative perspectives.

Tribalism can also lead to a lack of innovation and creativity, as individuals may be unwilling to explore new ideas or approaches that are outside of their tribal norms. Tribalism can be detrimental to the success of a software engineering team, as it can hinder collaboration and hinder the ability of the team to adapt to changing circumstances.

Talk about in-group, out-group stuff.
