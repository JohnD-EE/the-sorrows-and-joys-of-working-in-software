# Chapter 5: Tribes

## Intent:
The study of Sociology is arguably as relevant to Software Engineering as Computer Science.  Whether we are a small band of hunter-gatherers coordinating the capture of our next meal accross the lush Paleolithic grasslands of the Sahara, or a team of Engineers collaborating to build, test and deploy a new feature, we will naturally form groups to work towards a shared goal.  A sense of identy will emerge from within our small groups as we develop our own subcultures, our own in-jokes, styles, languages and preferences.  We may begin to find ourselves conforming to the expectations of others in our group, and may develop a shared dislike for other groups, feeling the need to protect and defend the values of our own group against the crazy batshit ways of the others.  The tribes we belong to, our teams, friendship circles, political allies, companies, favourite sports teams, music fan clubs, countries, religious allegiences, all become intertwined with our own ego, an inseperable part of us.

This chapter looks at how our tribal tendancies affect our thoughts, feelings and behaviours, with the aim of helping us to collaborate more wisely in groups of fellow humans.
