# Chapter 2: Beliefs

## Intent:
Our perception of reality is skewed by our beliefs, values, and assumptions.  Our beliefs, values, and assumptions are shaped our unique experiences, cultural conditioning and socialisation and are continually influenced by our internal states, our emotions, thoughts, and feelings.  Our beliefs and values are not fixed, but can be modified and expanded through the process of learning and personal growth.  We make maps and models of the world which are quite useful, but always wrong.  Software Engineers, despite being widely regarded as logical thinkers, are not immune to holding faulty beliefs, but so often we delude ourselves into thinking we are right, and therein lies the source of our many predicaments.

Here we will delve into the way our beliefs are formed, how utterly wrong they can be, and how challenging our beliefs and expanding our horizons, we can gain a deeper understanding of the world and ourselves, opening us up to new possibilities and potentials.

## The Inner Game of Coding
You can only learn code by doing code, but doing code will take you into treacherous uncharted waters where you'll encounter mythical monsters of the deep that will swallow you whole, and it's inside the belly of the beast that you'll discover what you're made of, what will break you and what will make you, whether you can rescue yourself or whether you can follow the breadcrumbs of countless Software Engineers who have fallen this way before and surmount the unsurmountable.

Of course the sea monsters aren't real and you are only sailing unchartered waters of your mind when you are inevitably stretched beyond your previous limits.  Solving problems with code is hard.  You'll tie yourself in knots, you'll find yourself awash with self-doubt, shamed by comparing yourself to your idea of rockstar programmers, and stranded upon the sorrowful shores of inadequacy as you fight to overcome your limitations when wrestling with complicated code.

Coding is an inner game, and the beast within will reveal itself and make your life a misery.  Golf is an inner game, as is tennis or snooker.  The Inner Game of Golf is a classic book written by W. Timothy Gallwey that explores the psychological aspects of golf and how they affect performance on the course.  According to Gallwey, the 'inner game' relates to the mental struggles and distractions that players face during a round of golf, which can inhibit their ability to play their best.

The book discusses the role of the 'Self 1' and the 'Self 2' in the inner game.  Self 1 represents the ego, the part of the mind that is constantly evaluating and criticising our performance.  Self 2 is the inner wisdom and calm that allows us to perform at our best.  The goal of the inner game is to quieten Self 1 and allow Self 2 to take control, so the player trust their natural abilities and instincts.

Just as in the inner game of golf or tennis, the key to success in the inner game of coding is to recognize and overcome these mental and emotional obstacles.  It's not about the external challenges you face, but rather how you approach and respond to them internally.  How you can successfully play the inner game of coding?
