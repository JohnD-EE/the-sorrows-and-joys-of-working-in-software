# Chapter 2: Beliefs

## Intent:
Our perception of reality is skewed by our beliefs, values, and assumptions.  Our beliefs, values, and assumptions are shaped our unique experiences, cultural conditioning and socialisation and are continually influenced by our internal states, our emotions, thoughts, and feelings.  Our beliefs and values are not fixed, but can be modified and expanded through the process of learning and personal growth.  We make maps and models of the world which are quite useful, but always wrong.  Software Engineers, despite being widely regarded as logical thinkers, are not immune to holding faulty beliefs, but so often we delude ourselves into thinking we are right, and therein lies the source of our many predicaments.

Here we will delve into the way our beliefs are formed, how utterly wrong they can be, and how challenging our beliefs and expanding our horizons, we can gain a deeper understanding of the world and ourselves, opening us up to new possibilities and potentials.
