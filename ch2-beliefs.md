# Chapter 2: Beliefs

## Intent:
We see the world not through our eyes but through our beliefs.  Our perception of reality is skewed by our beliefs, values, and assumptions.  We see what we expect to see.  Our beliefs, values, and assumptions are shaped our unique experiences, cultural conditioning and socialisation and are continually influenced by our internal states, our emotions, thoughts, and feelings.  Our beliefs and values are not fixed, but can be modified and expanded through the process of learning and personal growth.  We make maps and models of the world which are quite useful, but always wrong.  Software Engineers, despite being widely regarded as logical thinkers, are not immune to holding faulty beliefs, but so often we delude ourselves into thinking we are right, and therein lies the source of our many predicaments.

Here we will delve into the way our beliefs are formed, how utterly wrong they can be, and how challenging our beliefs and expanding our horizons, we can gain a deeper understanding of the world and ourselves, opening us up to new possibilities and potentials.

## The Inner Game of Coding
You can only learn code by doing code, but doing code will take you into treacherous uncharted waters where you'll encounter mythical monsters of the deep that will swallow you whole, and it's inside the belly of the beast that you'll discover what you're made of, what will break you and what will make you, whether you can rescue yourself or whether you can follow the breadcrumbs of countless Software Engineers who have fallen this way before and surmount the unsurmountable.

Of course the sea monsters aren't real and you are only sailing unchartered waters of your mind when you are inevitably stretched beyond your previous limits.  Solving problems with code is hard.  You'll tie yourself in knots, you'll find yourself awash with self-doubt, shamed by comparing yourself to your idea of rockstar programmers, and stranded upon the sorrowful shores of inadequacy as you fight to overcome your limitations when wrestling with complicated code.

Coding is an inner game, and the beast within will reveal itself and make your life a misery.  The outer game is our commits to the codebase, our interractions with colleagues, our contribution in meetings.  The inner game is what's going inside our minds and bodies.  A large proportion of Tennis is an inner game, as is golf or snooker.  The Inner Game of Tennis was the first of the 'Inner Game' genres written by Timothy Gallwey that explores the psychological aspects of tennis and how they affect performance during a game.  According to Gallwey, the 'inner game' relates to the mental struggles and distractions that players face during a match, which can inhibit their ability to play their best.

The books discuss the role of the 'Self 1' and the 'Self 2' in the inner game.  Self 1 represents the ego, the part of the mind that is constantly evaluating and criticising our performance.  Self 2 is the inner wisdom and calm that allows us to perform at our best.  The goal of the inner game is to quieten Self 1 and allow Self 2 to take control, so the player trust their natural abilities and instincts.

Self 1 is the part of the mind that is responsible for conscious thoughts, judgements, and decision-making.  It is the part of the mind that is constantly analysing and trying to control the situation.  However, in the inner game, when Self 1 is too dominant it can be a hindrance to performance by getting in the way of the natural flow of the game, generating a stream of negative self-talk if we allow it.  We will tense up and make mistakes.  Self 2, on the other hand, is the unconscious, intuitive part of the mind that is responsible for physical movements and behaviours.  It is the part of the mind that is able to perform naturally, in flow, and without overthinking.  Self 2 is the part of our mind we need to learn to develop and trust in order to perform at our besr.

Quietening Self 1 requires us not to judge our actions as right or wrong, and to view outcomes neutrally as just data points.  You hit the ball into the net, it's just data.  You introduce a bug into production code, it's just data - train yourself to deal with the facts of the situation as a neutral observer, without applying judgement.  Letting go of self-judgment requires us to focus on the process rather than the outcome.  Continually reminding themselves to let go of self-judgement can help a player, or a Software Engineer, to stay relaxed and to avoid getting too caught up in the pressure of performing well.  The idea that we should trust the unconscious could be refuted by arguing that coding is primarily a conscious thinking game,

Act the part - Embrace challenges - 

Just as in the inner game of tennis or golf, the key to success in the inner game of coding is to recognize and overcome these mental and emotional obstacles.  It's not about the external challenges you face, but rather how you approach and respond to them internally.  

Here are some reflections on how to play the inner game of coding?

* The inner game of coding is played at the Razor's Edge, the edge of consciousness, or the point at which we are most aware of ourselves and the world around us.
* Be mindful that you are playing an inner game, the outcome of which is the outer game of creating a Pull Request.
* Find a path to a state of grace when you are coding, appreciate the need for a calm mind.
* Realise that your opponent is not the person standing the other side of the net, it is you.
* The primary aim of the inner game when coding, or thinking, is to overcome self-interference and your self-imposed limitations.
* The inner game of coding is one that is played against your own habitual ways of getting in your own way.
* Outer game rewards of approval, recognition and success are not as important as the inner game rewards gained from personal and subjective experience.
* Outer games are usually finite games, there's a winner and an ending to the game.  Inner games are infinite, the aim is simply to keep playing.
* Coding solutions to challenging problems should feel like play.  We play games for fun, for love.  If it doesn't feel like play, you may be wise to change the game, or change the venue in which you are playing the game.


I can relate personally to the thinking from the inner game, not only in the various sports I've tried over the years, but also in learning and performing with musical instruments.  I play the guitar, an instrument that is very unforgiving of 'mistakes', especially when played through a 100 Watt amplifier.  A guitar string can be plucked in so many different ways, each creating a different shape to the sound.  Likewise, a note can be 'bent' up to resonate at different tone, it can be wobbled to cause vibrato, with slide, legato or even muted.  A guitar player is actively listening to the notes played in a constant feedback loop so that more or less pressure can be applied along with other modifications to reach the intended sound.  In effect, every note is a 'mistake' as the play wrestles the steel and nickel wound strings to resonate 'correctly' aginst the wood of the fretboard.  It can be easy to imagine yourself sounding like Jimi Hendrix playing along to a jam track in your own bedroom, but when you are performing to an audience of real people, you will notice your Self 1 taking over, aware and attentive to every unintend note, so much more noticable to the player than the crowd of people enjoying the music.
