# Chapter 6: Interbeing

## Intent:
Charles Eisenstein, the social philosopher and author relates the concept of interbeing to the interconnectedness of all things in the universe.  According to Eisenstein, everything that exists is interconnected and interdependent, and everything is constantly influencing and being influenced by everything else.  In his book "The More Beautiful World Our Hearts Know is Possible", Eisenstein argues that this interconnectedness extends beyond the physical world and also applies to the social, cultural, and spiritual realms.  He posits that our individual identities, as well as the systems and institutions that shape our society, are not separate and isolated entities, but are instead interconnected and interdependent.  This challenges the conventional idea of individualism and the notion that we are separate and independent beings.  Instead, he advocates for a more holistic and interconnected view of the world, where our actions and decisions have far-reaching consequences and implications for the larger whole.  By recognising the interconnectedness of all things, we can begin to work towards a more compassionate and sustainable world.

The aim of this chapter is to think about our close coupling to everything, to transcend our inatinctive and habitual patterns of relating to one another, to zoom out and think of the comsic interelatedness of everything we do.
