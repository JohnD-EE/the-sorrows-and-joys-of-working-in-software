# Chapter 8: Systems

## Intent:
Machines are complicated, but systems are complex.  Machines are complicated because they are made up of many different parts that work together in a specific way to perform a particular task.  These parts may be physical components, such as gears and motors, or they may be digital components, such as algorithms and software.  Despite the apparent complexity of these individual parts, the way in which they interact with each other is generally well-understood and predictable.  As a result, machines can be designed and built to perform specific tasks with a high degree of reliability and efficiency.

Systems, on the other hand, are complex because they are made up of many different parts that interact with each other in a way that is not always well-understood or predictable. These parts may be machines or software components, but they may also be people, organisations, or even entire societies.  The interactions between these parts can be highly dynamic, with feedback loops and emergent behaviour that can make it difficult to predict the behaviour of the system as a whole.  As a result, systems are often less reliable and less efficient than machines, but they are also capable of adapting and evolving in response to changing conditions.

This chapter explores how thinking in systems gives us a real world appreciation of complexity and considers the implications for organisation, management and leadership within the systems of life and work.

## Systems Thinking
Syestems thinking is a way of thinking about, and understanding, the world as a series of interconnected systems, rather than as a collection of isolated parts.  The systems thinking approach emphasises the relationships and interactions between different elements within a system, and the importance of considering the whole system in understanding its behaviour.

## Feedback Loops
A feedback loop is a process in which the output of a system is fed back into the system as input, influencing its future behaviour.  Feedback loops can be positive or negative, and can help a system to maintain stability or to drive change.

## Multi Order Effects
Multi order effects refer to the cascading or domino-like effects that can occur within a system as a result of changes at one level influencing other levels.  For example, a change in the behaviour of one group of people can lead to changes in the behaviour of other groups, which can in turn lead to changes in the overall system.

## Systems Ecology
Systems ecology is the study of the interactions and relationships between different elements within an ecosystem, such as the plants, animals, and microorganisms that live in a particular environment.  It focuses on understanding how changes at one level of the ecosystem can affect other levels, and how the ecosystem as a whole functions and evolves.

## Problems vs Predicaments
In systems thinking, a problem is a specific issue that can be isolated and addressed, typically with a known solution.  A predicament, on the other hand, is a complex, interconnected set of issues that cannot be easily resolved, and may require systemic changes to address.

## The Learning Organisation
The learning organization is a term used to describe organisations that are able to continually adapt and improve by learning from their experiences and their environment.  A learning organization is characterised by a culture of continuous learning and experimentation, and a willingness to embrace change and uncertainty.

## Leverage Points
In systems thinking, leverage points are specific places within a system where a small change can have a disproportionate effect on the behaviour of the system as a whole.  Leverage points can be useful for identifying where interventions or changes are most likely to have the greatest impact on a system.

## Environmental Detarminismn
Environmental determinism is the idea that the physical environment is the primary factor in shaping human behaviour and culture.  Environmental determinists argue that the environment determines the characteristics and development of a society, rather than the other way around.

## System Failure
System failure refers to the breakdown or collapse of a system, typically as a result of internal or external factors.  System failures can have significant consequences for the people and organisations that rely on the system, and can be difficult to predict or prevent.

## Ostrich Effect
The ostrich effect is the tendency for individuals or organisations to avoid dealing with problems or challenges by denying their existence or refusing to acknowledge them.  The term comes from the common misconception that ostriches bury their heads in the sand to avoid danger.

## Conway's Law
Conway's Law is a principle in systems engineering that states that the structure of a system will reflect the structure of the organisation that created it.  This means that the way in which an organisation is structured and the way in which it communicates will have a significant impact on the design and functionality of the systems it creates.

## Is it Workable?
Can you find some sense of empowerment within the system to make it 'workable' - to find some approach to a situation that works for you.

## Brooks Law
Brooks Law is a principle in software engineering which states that adding more developers to a project that is behind schedule will only make it take longer to complete.  This is because additional developers will need time to familiarise themselves with the codebase and existing workflows, which can slow down the overall progress of the project.  Brooks Law suggests that it is better to focus on improving the productivity of existing team members rather than simply adding more people to the project.

Focus on the relationships, not the nodes.

## Systemantics
Systemantics is a term coined by John Gall to refer to the study of systems and their behaviour.  This includes understanding the principles and rules that govern the behavior of systems, as well as the ways in which systems can be designed and managed to achieve desired outcomes.  Systemantics is often used in the context of systems thinking, which is a holistic approach to problem-solving that focuses on understanding the interconnectedness and complexity of systems.
