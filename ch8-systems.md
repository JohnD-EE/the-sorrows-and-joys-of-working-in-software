# Chapter 8: Systems

## Intent:
Machines are complicated, but systems are complex.  Machines are complicated because they are made up of many different parts that work together in a specific way to perform a particular task.  These parts may be physical components, such as gears and motors, or they may be digital components, such as algorithms and software.  Despite the apparent complexity of these individual parts, the way in which they interact with each other is generally well-understood and predictable.  As a result, machines can be designed and built to perform specific tasks with a high degree of reliability and efficiency.

Systems, on the other hand, are complex because they are made up of many different parts that interact with each other in a way that is not always well-understood or predictable. These parts may be machines or software components, but they may also be people, organisations, or even entire societies.  The interactions between these parts can be highly dynamic, with feedback loops and emergent behaviour that can make it difficult to predict the behaviour of the system as a whole.  As a result, systems are often less reliable and less efficient than machines, but they are also capable of adapting and evolving in response to changing conditions.

This chapter explores how thinking in systems gives us a real world appreciation of complexity and considers the implications for organisation, management and leadership within the systems of life and work.
