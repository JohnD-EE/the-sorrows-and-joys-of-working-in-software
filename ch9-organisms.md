# Chapter 9: Organisms

## Intent:
An organism is a a complex system imbued with the qualia of life.  An organism is a sentient, organised, cohesive system that is in a state of balance, or homeostasis.  When an organism is in a state of homeostasis, all of its parts work together in harmony to maintain a stable internal environment.  For The heart, lungs, and other organs in the body all have specific roles to play in maintaining the organism's life.  The heart pumps blood, the lungs oxygenate the blood, and the digestive system breaks down food and absorbs nutrients.  All of these processes are carefully regulated to maintain the organism's health and wellbeing.

When an organisation or team is functioning as a sentient, orgnaised, cohesive system, all of its parts are working together harmoniously to achieve its goals and maintain its function.  This can result in a more productive, efficient, and effective work environment.  It is better equipped to respond to challenges and changes in its environment.  Just as an organism can adapt to its surroundings, a well-functioning organization can adapt to changes in the market, technology, or other external factors.  This can help the organization to remain competitive and successful in a constantly changing world.

The aim of this chapter is to use the analogy of the organsim to describe an idealised approach to collaborating as a team of Software Engineers.  Although ideals are rarely attainable in reality, the do provide an aspiration to guide our decisions and actions.
