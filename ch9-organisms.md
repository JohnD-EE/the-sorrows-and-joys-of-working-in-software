# Chapter 9: Organisms

## Intent:
An organism is a a complex system imbued with the qualia of life.  An organism is a sentient, organised, cohesive system that is in a state of balance, or homeostasis.  When an organism is in a state of homeostasis, all of its parts work together in harmony to maintain a stable internal environment.  For The heart, lungs, and other organs in the body all have specific roles to play in maintaining the organism's life.  The heart pumps blood, the lungs oxygenate the blood, and the digestive system breaks down food and absorbs nutrients.  All of these processes are carefully regulated to maintain the organism's health and wellbeing.

When an organisation or team is functioning as a sentient, orgnaised, cohesive system, all of its parts are working together harmoniously to achieve its goals and maintain its function.  This can result in a more productive, efficient, and effective work environment.  It is better equipped to respond to challenges and changes in its environment.  Just as an organism can adapt to its surroundings, a well-functioning organization can adapt to changes in the market, technology, or other external factors.  This can help the organization to remain competitive and successful in a constantly changing world.

The aim of this chapter is to use the analogy of the organsim to describe an idealised approach to collaborating as a team of Software Engineers.  Although ideals are rarely attainable in reality, the do provide an aspiration to guide our decisions and actions.

## Sentience
The ability to perceive and be aware of one's surroundings and experiences.

## Spirit
The non-physical part of a being, often considered to be the source of consciousness or personality.

## Homeostasis
The maintenance of a stable internal environment within an organism.

## Nourishment
The provision of necessary materials, such as food and water, to an organism to support its own growth and survival.

## Anitfragility
The ability of a system to not only withstand stress and shocks, but to actually thrive and become stronger as a result.

## Self-Healing

## Order and Chaos

## Bitcoin as an Organism?
The idea that the decentralised, self-sustaining network of nodes that make up the Bitcoin network can be thought of as an organism with its own unique characteristics and behaviours

## Morphic Resonance
The idea that similar systems can influence each other's behaviour across time and space, even if they are not directly connected.
