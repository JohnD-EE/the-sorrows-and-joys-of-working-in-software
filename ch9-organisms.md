# Chapter 9: Organisms

## Intent:
An organism is a a complex system imbued with the qualia of life.  An organism is a sentient, organised, cohesive system that is in a state of balance, or homeostasis.  When an organism is in a state of homeostasis, all of its parts work together in harmony to maintain a stable internal environment.  For The heart, lungs, and other organs in the body all have specific roles to play in maintaining the organism's life.  The heart pumps blood, the lungs oxygenate the blood, and the digestive system breaks down food and absorbs nutrients.  All of these processes are carefully regulated to maintain the organism's health and wellbeing.

When an organisation or team is functioning as a sentient, orgnaised, cohesive system, all of its parts are working together harmoniously to achieve its goals and maintain its function.  This can result in a more productive, efficient, and effective work environment.  It is better equipped to respond to challenges and changes in its environment.  Just as an organism can adapt to its surroundings, a well-functioning organization can adapt to changes in the market, technology, or other external factors.  This can help the organization to remain competitive and successful in a constantly changing world.

The aim of this chapter is to use the analogy of the organsim to describe an idealised approach to collaborating as a team of Software Engineers.  Although ideals are rarely attainable in reality, the do provide an aspiration to guide our decisions and actions.

## Sentience
The ability to perceive and be aware of one's surroundings and experiences.

## Spirit
The non-physical part of a being, often considered to be the source of consciousness or personality.

## Emergence
The emergence of new, complex behaviours or properties from the interactions of simpler components.

## Nourishment
The provision of necessary materials, such as food and water, to an organism to support its own growth and survival.

## Anitfragility
The ability of a system to not only withstand stress and shocks, but to actually thrive and become stronger as a result.  This section explains antifragily, the following sections exapnd on this to investigate ccertain characteristics of an orgnism that can make it antifragile.

## Homeostasis
The self-regulating maintenance of a stable internal environment within an organism.  In the human body for example, this can involve a range of phisiological processes, such as regulating body temperature, heart rate, blood sugar levels, blood oxidation, pH levels, blood pressure, water balance and a whole range of other physiological functions. The organims actively and unconsciously controls and regulates its own internal behaviours.  There are a whole range of sensors and triggers which act independently to keep the system as a whole in balance.  For many internal processes there is a very fine balance needed in order to ensure the survival of the human body, blood pH for example blood pH must not stray from around 7.35-7.45 in order to keep the blood slightly alkaline and prevent acidosis (low blood pH) or alkalosis (high blood pH).  

## Self-Healing
The ability of an organism to repair and regenerate damaged or injured tissues without outside intervention.

## Self-Sustaining

## Self-Replicating
The ability of an organism to produce offspring that are genetically identical to itsel.

## Self-Improving
The ability of an organism to adapt and evolve over time in response to changes in its environment.

## Self-Defending
Immune Systems

## Order and Chaos
The balance between organised, predictable behaviour and random, unpredictable behaviour within a system.

## Complexity
The state or quality of being composed of interconnected parts that are arranged in a way that is difficult to understand or analyse.

## Illusion of Control
The psychological phenomenon in which an individual believes that they have control over events that are actually beyond their control.

## Bitcoin as an Organism?
The idea that the decentralised, self-sustaining network of nodes that make up the Bitcoin network can be thought of as an organism with its own unique characteristics and behaviours

## Morphic Resonance
The idea that similar systems can influence each other's behaviour across time and space, even if they are not directly connected.

## Disease
Any abnormal condition that impairs the normal functioning of an organism.

## Death
The permanent end of the life (EOL) of an organism.
