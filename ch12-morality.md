# Chapter 12: Morality

## Intent:
We live in an era of exponentiating social problems and global predicaments tempered with the promise of exponentiating advancements in technology with which to solve them.  However, the rapid pace of technological change also presents new challenges and ethical dilemmas and the ability of societies and governments to adapt to and effectively utilise technology effectively is dubious, to say the least.  Our stone age emotions and mediaeval institutions leave us poorly equipped to deal with the 'Promethean Gap' as we are incapable of imagining the consequences of our creations.  Responsible and ethical use of technology is far from guaranteed, and conversations about the morality of what we do with our God-like capacity to build anything we conceive in the digital landscape has never been more existentially important.  Our technical prowess is creating an ever larger Promethean Gap way beyond our human capacity to deal with it, raising a slew of ethical questions and concerns.  Technology augments our brilliance, but can also exponentially amplify our collective ignorance.

Computer Science as a discipline does not provide a systematic education in general humanism, a philosophical study of ethics and language, human history, psychology and sociology.  A lack of curiosity in these subjects can lead to a narrow, technical perspective on the use of technology and its ethical implications.

This chapter, and ultimately the whole damn book, aims to encourage the development of human wisdom in order to intelligently consider the moral impact of our collective technological genius.

## Sphere of Influence
Sphere of influecne is a more socially acceptable way of talking about the idea of power, and the power we have to influence other people.  Our power is determined by many factors including our skills and abilities, our knowledge over the domain in question, our credibility, our social networks, and our overall standing in the dominance hierarchy society.  Unless you are Elon Musk reading these words, or similarly connected those pulling the stings of global influence, it is unlikely that you are able to make a significant impact on the moral and ethical concerns of the world.

In the many conversations I have with Software Engineers and others in the Software ecosystems it is easy to notice that people do generally care about the ethical consequences of their work.  Code can be weaponised against humanity, used to manipulate people's decisions and behaviours in ways that are unfavourable to their prosperity and the prosperity of the world at large.  Our beautifully crafted algorithm can have far greater influence over humanity that the most tyranical dictator.  Arguably, the Software industry wields more power over humanity than any other intustry as technology pervades ever further into our everyday lives.  While people think about ethical issues concerning the uses of the software systems and applications they build, they equally acknowledge that it is difficult for them to influence the intended uses in a moral direction.  We must often blinker ourselves to the ethical consequences of the uses and misuses of our software and focus instead on the areas within our control, function, beauty, and the relationships with our colleagues.

A sobering thought, however, is that 'no man is an island' from the perspective of our universal interbeing, and every act, no matter how small, can be the tiny pebble thrown into the ocean of humanity which initiates a ripple effect that reverbersates through all of time and space.  Every choice we make in our day-to-day lives has an ethical aspect.  We can always choose the to do the right thing, no matter how subtle, which can nudge the world in a better direction.
