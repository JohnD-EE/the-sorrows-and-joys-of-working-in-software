# Chapter 10: Function

## Intent:
The are many engineering disciplines and in each, the concept of function defines the purpose and capabilities of a component or system.  By understanding the function, engineers can design and build systems that are effective, efficient, and well-suited to their intended use.  The function of computer software is to provide the instructions and tools that enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks and processes, from managing and controlling the system to providing specific functionalities and capabilities for users.  The function of software is to reliably combine the capabilities of its components in order to produce a desired outcome or result.  One of the many challenges of Software Engineering is to truly understand the desired outcome or result.  Our task is to translate complex real world requirements into code which is realiably executed under a variety of conditions which are not always clear at the outset of a software project.  In the real world, Software rarely provides the intended function.

This chapter covers the core job of Software Engineering depatments: to build, test, deploy, run, and maintain functional software.
