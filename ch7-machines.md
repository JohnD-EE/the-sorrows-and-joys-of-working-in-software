# Chapter 7: Machines

## Intent:
One of the defining characteristics of the human species is our ability to invent and use tools and technologies to enhance and transform our natural capabilities.  From the earliest stone tools used by our ancestors to hunt and gather food, to the sophisticated machines and systems that we use today to explore the depths of space and the inner workings of the human body, humans have consistently demonstrated our ability to create and use tools to extend the limits of our abilities.  Yet our technical success as a species has shaped our lives in ways we may not realise.  Our mechanistic thinking has penetrated so many aspects of our lives that we have become cultural cyborgs, we view people through the mechanical lens, as fungible components to be organised into production lines to extract optimal utility.  Human relationships are mediated through technology to such a degree that we have lost sight of the humanity and individuality of the people around us, treating them as interchangeable parts in the machine of society rather than as unique and valuable

This chapter explores the ways our ubiquitous mechanistic thinking influences our work in the Software industry and how that affects us as human beings.

## Factories
The factory mindset refers to the idea of organising people and companies in a similar way to how machines and processes are organised in a factory.

## Robots


## Cyborgs

## Components

## Cogs

## Spanners

## Manufacturing Principles and Methodologies
The idea that manufacturing principles and methodologies can be applied to software engineering environments is based on the assumption that software development and manufacturing have many similarities.  Both involve the creation of a product through a systematic and structured process, and both require the use of specialised tools and techniques to achieve a desired outcome.

As a result, many of the principles and methodologies used in manufacturing can also be applied to software engineering environments. This can include things like using standardised processes and procedures, adopting a systems approach to design and development, and implementing quality control and assurance measures.

By applying manufacturing principles and methodologies to software engineering environments, it is possible to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the software development process, and to produce high-quality software products that meet the needs of users. This approach can also help to reduce waste and defects, and to increase collaboration and communication among team members.

However, a counterargument could be that the world of creative arts has more in common with software engineering.  By applying the styles, approachs, thinking, practices, and concepts from the creative arts to software engineering environments, it is possible to enhance the creativity and innovation of the software development process, and to produce software products that are not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly.  This approach can also help to foster a more collaborative and imaginative work culture among software engineers.

From here we will dig deeper into the ways the manufacturing mindset has shaped our thinking in developing software, and explore the many sorrows caused from thinking in this mechanistic way which subverts the aesthetics and the qualia of the human experience.

## Lean Manufacturing Principles
TWith their origins in the automotive industry, lean manufactruing focuses on waste reduction and increasing efficiency.  In software engineering, lean principles can be applied to improve the development process by focusing on delivering value to the customer and eliminating activities that do not contribute to that goal.

## Theory of Constriants (ToC)
ToC, developed by Eliyahu Goldratt, focuses on identifying and addressing the constraints that limit the performance of a manufacturing system.  In software engineering, the Theory of Constraints can be applied to identify and eliminate bottlenecks in the development process in order to improve productivity and efficiency.

## Total Quality Management (TQM)
Developed by W. Edwards Deming, TQM is based on the idea that quality should be a primary focus throughout the manufacturing process.  In software engineering, Total Quality Management principles can be applied to ensure that software systems are developed to the highest possible quality standards.

## The Toyota Production System:
This system, which was developed by the Toyota Motor Corporation, is a set of principles and practices that focus on maximising efficiency and minimising waste in manufacturing processes.  In software engineering, the Toyota Production System can be applied to improve the development process by focusing on continuous improvement and collaboration among team members.

## Six Signma
Six Sigma, originally developed by Motorola, focuses on reducing defects and improving the quality of manufactured products.  In software engineering, Six Sigma principles can be applied to improve the reliability and performance of software systems.

## Rules

## People as Fungible Components
People may be seen as interchangeable and easily replaceable, like other components in a system.  This may lead to a lack of value placed on individual contributions and personal development.

## Ghosts in the Machine

## Artificial Intelligence

## Toyota Model
The Toyota Model refers to a system of manufacturing that emphasises continuous improvement and the involvement of workers in decision-making.  In the context of the factory mindset, the Toyota model may be seen as a more human-centered approach to organising people and companies.
