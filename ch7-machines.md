# Chapter 7: Machines

## Intent:
One of the defining characteristics of the human species is our ability to invent and use tools and technologies to enhance and transform our natural capabilities.  From the earliest stone tools used by our ancestors to hunt and gather food, to the sophisticated machines and systems that we use today to explore the depths of space and the inner workings of the human body, humans have consistently demonstrated our ability to create and use tools to extend the limits of our abilities.  Yet our technical success as a species has shaped our lives in ways we may not realise.  Our mechanistic thinking has penetrated so many aspects of our lives that we have become cultural cyborgs, we view people through the mechanical lens, as fungible components to be organised into production lines to extract optimal utility.  Human relationships are mediated through technology to such a degree that we have lost sight of the humanity and individuality of the people around us, treating them as interchangeable parts in the machine of society rather than as unique and valuable

This chapter explores the ways our ubiquitous mechanistic thinking influences our work in the Software industry and how that affects us as human beings.

## People as Fungible Components
People may be seen as interchangeable and easily replaceable, like other components in a system.  This may lead to a lack of value placed on individual contributions and personal development.

## Ghosts in the Machine

## Artificial Intelligence

## Toyota Model
The Toyota Model refers to a system of manufacturing that emphasises continuous improvement and the involvement of workers in decision-making.  In the context of the factory mindset, the Toyota model may be seen as a more human-centered approach to organising people and companies.
